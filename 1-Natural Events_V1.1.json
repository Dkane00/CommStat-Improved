Emergency agencies then amplify these alerts via cell broadcasts, sirens, and radio, leveraging lead times that range from hours for hurricanes (NHC warnings at 36-hour mark) to seconds for earthquakes (USGS ShakeAlert system). Crucially, all official warnings are proactive.",

Moderate Intensity (VI–VIII) triggers structural harm—chimney collapses at VI, partial failures in vulnerable structures at VII, and foundation shifts/wall damage at VIII. Extreme Intensity (IX–XII) produces catastrophic destruction: violent shaking (IX) topples well-built buildings, while X–XII causes near-total disintegration, ground ruptures, and infrastructure annihilation. This progression directly informs emergency response protocols and structural safety assessments.",
        "*** Tornado ***": "Tornado damage severity escalates systematically across EF-scale tiers: Weak (EF0–EF1) causes minor structural effects—broken branches, peeled roof surfaces, and damaged gutters—with EF1 lifting roofs off poorly anchored structures. Strong (EF2–EF3) triggers significant destruction: EF2 snaps large trees and rips roofs off well-built homes; EF3 collapses exterior walls, overturns trains, and debarks trees. Violent (EF4–EF5) produces near-total devastation: EF4 flattens well-constructed houses and hurls vehicles airborne; EF5 obliterates reinforced buildings, scours foundations, and distorts skyscrapers—leaving landscapes unrecognizable. This progression directly informs shelter-in-place protocols and structural engineering standards.",
        "*** Hurricane ***": "Hurricane damage severity escalates distinctly across Saffir-Simpson tiers: Minor (Cat 1–2) inflicts non-structural harm—Cat 1 (74–95 mph) damages roofs/siding and topples shallow-rooted trees; Cat 2 (96–110 mph) causes major roof failure, snaps large trees, and triggers extended power outages. Major (Cat 3) (111–129 mph) initiates structural collapse: poorly built homes are destroyed, flooding reaches 4+ ft above ground, and communities face weeks without utilities. Catastrophic (Cat 4–5) (130+ mph) ensures near-total devastation—Cat 4 flattens well-constructed houses with 12+ ft storm surge; Cat 5 (157+ mph) obliterates reinforced structures, scours foundations, and inundates coastlines beyond 18 ft, rendering zones uninhabitable for months (NOAA, 2024).
