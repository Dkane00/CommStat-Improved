These high-transmission threats demand immediate boil-water advisories and supply-chain interventions to prevent outbreaks, as unaddressed contamination can infect thousands within hours. Prevention requires rapid environmental testing and point-of-use purification, since delays beyond 24 hours drastically increase mortality.",
        "*** Respiratory/Airborne ***": "Respiratory and airborne diseases are highly contagious infections spread through respiratory droplets or aerosols, often causing severe illness or death in dense populations. These pathogens exploit close-contact environments, requiring rapid implementation of isolation protocols, ventilation improvements, and mask mandates to curb exponential transmission—since unmitigated spread can overwhelm healthcare systems within days.",
        "*** Vector-Borne/Zoonotic ***": "Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases are infections transmitted by vectors like mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas, or directly from animals to humans, often triggering outbreaks in specific ecological conditions. Control demands aggressive vector suppression, vaccination campaigns for zoonotic threats, and habitat management—since unchecked vectors can amplify transmission across regions within weeks.",
        "*** Chemical/Biological/Radiological/Nuclear ***": "CBRN incidents involve exposure to hazardous chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents, causing immediate and long-term health risks, environmental damage, and societal disruption. These threats require specialized decontamination, containment, and monitoring to prevent cascading effects, as even small exposures can lead to mass casualties or infrastructure collapse within hours.",
        "*** Blood/Sexual ***": "Bloodborne and sexually transmitted diseases spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, often requiring long-term public health interventions like screening, contact tracing, and education to control chronic and epidemic spread.
